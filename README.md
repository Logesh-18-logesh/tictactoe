## HOW TO RUN THE FILE

- Pygame

## HOW MINMAX ALGORITHM WORKS

The Minimax algorithm ensures that the computer plays optimally against the player. It explores all possible future game states recursively and selects moves based on maximizing the computer's chances of winning while minimizing the player's chances. This makes the game challenging for players when they play against the computer.
